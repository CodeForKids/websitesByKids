	<p> this guide will now teach you how to start constructing the internals of the page. </p>
	
	<p> the first step you want to do is to go into your body area and type p <i> insert message here </i>.
	<p> you can do that as many times as you want to write a paragraph. </p>
	
	<p> after that you can write h1 h2 or h3 <i> insert text here </i> and then /h1 /h2 or /h3 to select </p>
	<p> the size of the text. example: in your body write h1 derp /h1 and your text will show up very large </p>
	<p> showing the message derp. </p>
	
	<p> the next thing you can do is write i b or u <i> insert text here </i> /i /b or /u and your text will show </p>
	<p> as either italic, bold, or underlined. </p>
	
	<p> this is the end of the medium section. I will start to teach you some css in hard. </p>
