		<p> OK, in this section I will be teaching you some CSS. I know this is a HTML </p>
		<p> guide, but CSS is important. </p>
		
		<p> the first thing you want to know how to do in css is to start css. </p>
		<p> to do that, you have to write in your head under your title style type="text/css"> </p>
		
		<p> the next thing you want to do is to change the background color. to do </p>
		<p> that, you write body { background-color: <i> insert color here </i>; </p>
		
		<p> in css you can change the color of certian areas of script, and for that </p>
		<p> you need a ID. to make a ID you write in the first command in the script that </p>
		<p> you want to change  id="<i>insert id here</i>" </p>
		
		<p> now to change the color of the script, you write in your style box <p>
		<p> #<i>insert ID here</i>  { color: <i>insert color here</i>; </p>
		
		<p> that is all the CSS you really need to know, so I won't go into very much detail. </p>
		<p> in the expert tutorial I will be showing you how to insert videos, pictures, and other cool stuff.</p>
